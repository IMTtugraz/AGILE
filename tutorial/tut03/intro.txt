\page tutorial03 Tutorial 3: Using sparse matrices on the GPU

<abstract>
This tutorial will introduce a sparse compressed row storage matrix. It shows
how to create such a matrix from coordinate storage and how to get it onto the
GPU. Further, the common matrix-vector products are demonstrated.

\section intro Introduction

We have learned how to create a GPU vector and a dense GPU matrix in the
previous tutorials. Now it is time to create a sparse matrix on the GPU.
