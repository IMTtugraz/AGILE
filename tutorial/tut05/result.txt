\section result Result

The program will produce output that is similar to the one printed below. Note
that even though the \p barrier methods are used, the order of the statements
might be confused. This shall be a hint that parallel output it not too
trivial to implement. The program ran on two processes on the same PC. Output
of the first run:

<code>
Process 0 of 2 is running on fbmtpc31<BR>
Process 1 of 2 is running on fbmtpc31<BR>
Process 0 has got the local value 1<BR>
Process 1 has got the local value 2<BR>
Process 0 has got the global value 3<BR>
Process 1 has got the global value 3<BR>
Process 1: accumulated v_i: 6 8 10 12 14 16 18<BR>
Process 0: accumulated v_i: 0 2 4 6 8 10 12<BR>
Process 0: distributed v_i: 0 2 4 3 4 5 6<BR>
Process 1: distributed v_i: 3 4 5 6 14 16 18<BR>
Process 0: accumulated v_i: 0 2 4 6 8 10 12<BR>
Process 1: accumulated v_i: 6 8 10 12 14 16 18<BR>
Process 0: local scalar product = 192<BR>
Process 1: local scalar product = 948<BR>
Process 0: global scalar product = 1140<BR>
Process 1: global scalar product = 1140<BR>
Reference solution = 1140<BR>
